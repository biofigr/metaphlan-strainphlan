## Shotgun Metagenomics (Marker-Based) 
MetaPhlAn, HUMAnN, and StrainPhlAn form a complementary suite for shotgun metagenomic profiling. MetaPhlAn identifies and quantifies microbial taxa directly from sequencing reads using unique clade-specific marker genes. HUMAnN builds on those results to profile functional potentialâ€”linking reads to metabolic pathways and gene families. StrainPhlAn refines the taxonomic picture further by reconstructing strain-level variation within species, enabling comparison across samples or subjects. Together, these methods deliver species- to strain-level insights in two-to-three weeks, ready for downstream statistical analysis.

## Input Requirements 

| Requirement | Specification |
|--------------|----------------|
| Input format | Paired- or single-end FASTQ (gzipped) |
| Recommended read length | 50â€“150 bp |
| Minimum read depth | â‰¥ 3 million reads per sample |
| Accepted platforms | Illumina (NovaSeq, NextSeq, HiSeq) |

- Input files should be clearly named using sample identifiers (`sampleID_R1.fastq.gz`, `sampleID_R2.fastq.gz`).  
- Invalid or corrupt FASTQs will halt processing and trigger a report notification.  
- Inclusion or re-analysis of public data (i.e., NCBI SRA/ENA) is supported following evaluation.

> <span style="color:#2563eb; font-weight:600;">ðŸ’¡ Note:</span>  
> To generate an accurate quotation and allocate sufficient storage, please specify the **number of samples** and the **approximate size of each FASTQ file**.  
> This information is required to estimate total disk usage and compute resources prior to analysis.
